# AWS-Carbon-Emission-Reporting-System
NK Inc, a prominent energy company in the USA, has embarked on a significant initiative aimed at comprehensively measuring and reporting carbon emissions stemming from its owned and operated assets, purchased energy sources, and third-party contributions. To achieve this, the project harnesses the capabilities of AWS Modern Data Architecture tools and services, which include S3, Glue, Redshift, Quicksight, and more. The core objectives of this project are centered around efficiently acquiring data from various sources, improving data organization, ensuring data reliability and transparency, and implementing data standardization protocols. In the context of this project, NK Inc is uploading its energy consumption data and monthly fleet usage to an S3 bucket. AWS Glue is then used for data transformation, facilitating a seamless flow of information into AWS Redshift for advanced analytics. The final step involves employing Quicksight to create informative dashboards that effectively convey insights to various stakeholders.
